Since the Lithosphere has a lower density, it floats on the Asthenosphere likewise an iceberg or a piece of wood float on water. The mantle is made of lot denser, thicker material, considering this the plates “float” on it like oil floats on water. Numerous geologists accept that the mantle “flows” over the plastic asthenosphere because of thermal convection currents. Divergent plate boundaries are areas where plates are moving away from each other. A constructive boundary is where the convection currents in the mantle move upwards. At the point when a constructive boundary happens underneath oceanic lithosphere, the rising convection current and flow beneath the lithosphere allow the formation of mid-ocean ridge. Divergent boundaries otherwise called ‘constructive plate margins’ because that new crust is formed at the mid oceanic ridges. Seafloor spreading is the consequence of the tensional stress along the mid-oceanic ridge because of convection. New oceanic lithosphere is formed as the sea plates diverge from one another, making the sea to enlarge. Oceanic crust originated by seafloor spreading in the East Pacific Rise is an example to be a part of the Ring of Fire, the horseshoe-shaped pattern of earthquake and volcanic zones around the Pacific Ocean basin. From the stripes of normal and converse attractive field noticed in rocks of sea floor we can be aware of about the age of rocks present in the sea floor.

Several environmental and human factors contribute to landslide hazard, principally by determining the susceptibility of a slope or geological system to instability. These preparatory factors include slope geometry, hydrology (surface and groundwater), soil type, underlying geology, vegetation and slope loading. Landslide triggering factors include rainfall, earthquake, volcanic activity, changes in groundwater, erosion or undercutting and human activities (e. g. mining, construction or deforestation). Hydrological processes can exert a significant and dynamic influence on slope stability, as both a landslide preparatory factors, in terms of pore pressure and groundwater levels within the slope, and as a landslide trigger factor due to rainfall infiltration or pre pressure changes. Depending on the hydrological properties of the slope material, an increase in moisture content and pore-water pressure can reduce the mechanical strength of the slope to the point of failure. Landslide consequences depend on the type and magnitude of the landslide: the process of emplacement or runout, which determines the rate, travel distance and volume of Debris (the hazard footprint): and the exposure and vulnerability of elements within the area of impact. Landslides can destroy or bury buildings, infrastructure and crops, cut off transport links, water and power supplies and result in significant direct and indirect economic losses.

Landslides can be slow as well as fast moving materials and aggravated material by human activities. Landfall has commonly most noteworthy velocity of movement, among others. Gravity is the essential main force for a landslide to happen, yet there are different components influencing slope stability that produce explicit conditions for making a slope prone to failure.

SiAl alludes to the earth՚s outsides upper layer (crust) which is comprised of rocks abundant in silicate and aluminum-based minerals. SiMa is 10 km denser than SiAl (continental crust) so that lighter Continental SiAl drifted over denser oceanic SiMa. Taylor indicated that there were two land masses during cretaceous period which are Lauratia and Gondwanaland situated close to the north and south poles, respectively. At the point when Pangaea separated, the northern continents that means North America and Eurasia (Laurasia) was isolated from the southern continents of India, South America, Australia, Africa, and Antarctica (Gondwanaland). The enormous northern continent is called Laurasia and the southern continent is called Gondwanaland. Anatolian plate imparts a boundary with the Eurasian Plate, the African Plate, the Arabian Plate, and the Aegean Sea Plate. This area is highly perceptible for the North Anatolian Fault, which was a part of Laurasia. Panthalassa was the super ocean that encompassed the supercontinent Pangaea. Panthalassa is likewise referred as the Paleo-Pacific or Proto-Pacific in the cause of the fact that the present Pacific Ocean was created from its center in the Mesozoic. Assertion(Ꭺ)\nAccording to Continental Drift theory, the Pangea broke into two sections\nReason(Ꭱ)\nPangea was a supercontinent encircled by a vast ocean.",

For example, debris flows, earth flows, mudflows, rock falls and deep-seated slope failures. Landslides includes rapid perceptible movement of dry mass of debris or bed rock and occur down a hill slope. Landslides can be slow as well as fast moving materials and aggravated material by human activities. Landfall has commonly most noteworthy velocity of movement, among others. Gravity is the essential main force for a landslide to happen, yet there are different components influencing slope stability that produce explicit conditions for making a slope prone to failure. As a rule, the landslide is activated by a particular event (for example, a heavy precipitation, an earthquake, time to build a road, and numerous others), in spite of the fact that this isn՚t constantly identifiable. Which of the accompanying alternatives is accurately arranged, as indicated by size of particles in them (Greater to smaller)?",
